Welcome to the GLM API Model Beginner's Warehouse in Exploration 📘。 This is an open-source GLM API introductory code textbook.


Here, you will find rich **code examples 👨**,**Practical Guide 🗺** And **resource links 🔗**， Perhaps it can help you easily master the use of GLM API!

## Recent Update 🔥

+ 🔥 2024-03-03: The warehouse has been updated [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/winily/zhipuai-sdk-nodejs-v4), if you are a Node.js user, you can try the Node.js version here SDK
+ 🔥 2024-03-02: The warehouse has been updated [C# SDK](https://github.com/zhipuai/zhipuai-sdk-csharp-v4), if you are a C# user, you can try the C# version here SDK
+ 🔥 2024-03-01: The warehouse has been updated [glms](asset/glms.md), some interesting GLMs (Zhipu Qingyan) are welcome to experience! GLM-4 API
   The maximum output length can be adjusted to `8192`, and it supports network tool calling, see you [here] (basic/glm_function_call.ipynb)
+ 🔥 2024-02-07: The warehouse has been updated with [InterpretationoDreams](demo/interpretationo_dreams), an experience project using GLM-4 to complete dream interpretation and role-playing!
+ 🔥 2024-02-04: The warehouse has been updated [List of interesting GLMs] (asset/glms.md), welcome to experience it! The basic tutorial has basically covered the content of the GLM-4 API document, welcome to experience it!
​

## Quick Start 🚀

1. To start using the GLM API, you first need a GLM API account and the corresponding API key.
    If you don’t have an account yet, you can register for free [here](https://open.bigmodel.cn/).

2. My code is based on **Python, Jupyter Note**, but the same concept can be applied to other programming languages (but you may have to implement it yourself).
    These code examples are intended to help me (and perhaps you) how to use the GLM API efficiently to complete common simple tasks. It is recommended to use `Python 3.9 - 3.12`
    version (my own is Python 3.10). You need to install the necessary dependencies to better use the Demo. You can use the following command to install total dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. By the way, I usually use ✅GLM4 to complete tasks. I also recommend you to use this model!

## Warehouse file 📂

I have classified multiple folders, each of which has its own content. You can view it according to your needs!

+ 🌱`basic` The most basic content is just a successful call.

+ 👁️`vision` About multi-modal calls and basic applications.

+ 🔧`finetune` Maybe you can come here to find fine-tuning content?

+ 🎉`demo` Some interesting demos, which may inspire some inspiration.
  + 🤖`agent` Let’s see how powerful the agent at the press conference is!
  + 📚`data` The data needed to run the demo.

+ 🏠`asset` Some related picture information.
  + 📊`glms` Some interesting GLMs (chatglm.cn, only chinese version). Welcome to experience!

You can quickly understand the structure of this warehouse through the following pictures. I will update the latest experiments and teaching content of Zhipu AI SDK as soon as possible.
