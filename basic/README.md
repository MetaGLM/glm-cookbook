# Basic Tutorial

Welcome to the basic tutorial. The content in this folder will help you quickly get started with the basic usage of GLM API. If you are using GLM API for the first time, you can learn by following these sections:

Basic Tutorial:

1. [Using HTTP requests to call GLM API](glm_http_request.ipynb)
2. [Using ZhipuAI Python SDK to call GLM API](glm_pysdk.ipynb)
3. [Using OpenAI Python SDK to call GLM API](glm_openai_sdk.ipynb)
4. [How API calculates token count](glm_token_count.ipynb)
5. [Using Function Call to create simple weather forecast queries](glm_function_call.ipynb)
6. [Simple usage of Embedding API](glm_embedding_pysdk.ipynb)
7. [Using ZhipuAI's built-in knowledge base tools to complete retrieval work](glm_retrieval.ipynb)
8. [Using Batch API to save more inference costs](glm_batch_api.ipynb)
9. [Using ultra-humanlike large models](character_glm_pysdk.ipynb)
10. [Using CodeGeeX large model to assist code work](codegeex.ipynb)
11. [Using GLM-4.5 series models in Claude Code](glm_claude_code.ipynb)

Application Framework:

1. [Using Langchain to call GLM API](glm_langchain.ipynb)

I will continuously supplement new basic content to ensure updates with GLM's API updates and new features.
