    "在使用普通的 GLM-4 模型对话时，我们会发现它不擅长逻辑思维方面的回答，例如解数学题或是要求模型一步步推理的任务。这时，我们可以试试 GLM-4-Plus。相比基础款的 GLM，它在语言理解、指令遵循、长文本处理等方面性能得到全面提升，并且模型推理（数学、代码算法题等）的表现更好。这篇内容用一道数学题的考察展现了 GLM-4-Plus 相比 GLM-4-0520 在数学问答中的提升。\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the chat completions of a regular GLM-4 model, we may find that it is not good at logical thinking answers, such as solving math problems or tasks that require the model to reason step by step. In this case, we can try the GLM-4-Plus, which offers improved performance over the base GLM in language comprehension, command following, long text processing, and better model reasoning (math, code algorithm questions, etc.). This content uses an examination of a math problem to show the improvement of GLM-4-Plus over GLM-4-0520 in a math quiz."
