The [GLM Coding Plan](https://bigmodel.cn/claude-code) uses a Claude Codeâ€“type API interface, with a different API endpoint.
If you need to switch to this plan, please continue with the following steps.

1. At the model selection location, choose `claude`, and change the `API BASE URL` to 

> https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic

Then enter the API KEY.

2. Verify whether you are using the GLM Coding Plan instead of regular credits.

In Kode, enter `/model` to check if it shows `anthropic glm-4.5`. If it does, then it's successful.
