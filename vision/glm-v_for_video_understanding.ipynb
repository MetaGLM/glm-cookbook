    "# Using GLM-4.5V for Video Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "[GLM-4.5V](https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/guide/models/vlm/glm-4.5v) is Z.AI's new generation visual reasoning model based on MOE architecture. With 106B total parameters and 12B activation parameters, it achieves SOTA performance among global open-source multimodal models of the same level across various benchmarks, covering common tasks such as image, video, document understanding, and GUI tasks. This code demonstrates how to use GLM-4.5V's video understanding functionality with videos."

    "Next, input the video into the model. Please note that only the `GLM-4.5V` model supports video understanding. After that, we need to encode the video into video_base64. The analysis can then be performed by the large model. A video understanding process usually takes only a few seconds. We can see the answer very quickly."

Whether it‚Äôs chasing imaginary fish or simply savoring the cool water between its toes, this dog proves that happiness often comes from the simplest, silliest moments‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre splashing around in your very own watery wonderland! üêæüí¶<|end_of_box|>\n"
